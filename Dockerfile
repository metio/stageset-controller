# The builder is pinned to the native build platform so multi-arch image builds
# cross-compile through Go's GOOS/GOARCH (CGO is disabled) instead of emulating
# each target under QEMU. buildx supplies TARGETOS/TARGETARCH/TARGETVARIANT per
# target; the runtime stage below takes $TARGETPLATFORM and pulls the matching
# distroless base. The builder is Docker Hub's official golang image, pinned in
# lockstep with the flake's Go so prod and dev builds agree — cgr.dev
# throttles anonymous pulls, making its large Go builder layer very slow to
# fetch in CI.
