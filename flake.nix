# The single source of the development toolchain: CI and local shells run every
# gate through this flake's devShell, so both use the exact tool versions pinned
# in flake.lock. The shared lint gate, the three from-source Go tools (arch-go,
# modernize, helm-schema), and the org-wide nixpkgs pin come from the metio/ci
# flake; Renovate keeps the lock fresh. The Go correctness gates run in CI via
# the shared metio/ci golang.yml; the same tools live here so a local
# `nix develop --command <tool>` reproduces the gate, and the flake serves the
# build / docs / dashboards / fuzz / kind-smoke jobs too. KUBEBUILDER_ASSETS is
# assembled from nixpkgs, so controller tests run offline with no setup-envtest
# download.
