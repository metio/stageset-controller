# Install Calico as the enforcing CNI on a disableDefaultCNI kind cluster (see
# kind-calico.yaml). kind's built-in kindnet does NOT enforce NetworkPolicy;
# Calico does. This uses the Tigera operator install (the recommended path)
# rather than the flat calico.yaml manifest, because the chart's `calico` engine
# renders projectcalico.org/v3 NetworkPolicy — the AGGREGATED Calico API, served
# by the calico-apiserver, which only the operator install (APIServer CR) brings
# up. The operator install also enforces vanilla networking.k8s.io NetworkPolicy,
# so it backs the chart's `kubernetes` engine too, and serves as the CNI for the
# clusterNetworkPolicy apply-level job. Usage: setup-calico.sh [calico-version]
